                <header>Try React </header>
                <p><a href="#">React </a> has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and <strong>you can use as little or as much React  as you need.</strong> Whether you want to get a taste of React , add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React -powered app, the links in this section will help you get started.</p>
                
                <h3>Online Playgrounds</h3>
                <p>If you’re interested in playing around with React , you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz.</p>
                <p>If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos.</p>
                
                <h3>Add React  to a Website</h3>
                <p>You can add React  to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.</p>
                
                <h3>Create a New React  App</h3>
                <p>When starting a React  project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up!</p>
                <p>As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React  ecosystem. Learn how.</p>
                <code>
                    if (condition) { statement_1_runs_if_condition_is_true;
                        statement_2_runs_if_condition_is_true; } else {
                        statement_3_runs_if_condition_is_false;
                        statement_4_runs_if_condition_is_false; }
                </code>

            <section class="main-section" id="Learn_React">
                <header>Learn React</header>
                <p>People come to React  from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.</p>
                <ul class="list-item">
                    <li>If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial.</li>
                    <li>If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>ike any unfamiliar technology, React  does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it.</p>
    
                <h3>First Examples</h3>
                <p>The <a target="_blank" href="#">React  homepage</a> contains a few small React  examples with a live editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React  yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result.</p>
    
                <h3>React  for Beginners</h3>
                <p>If you feel that the React  documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out this overview of React  by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React  concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try!</p>
    
                <h3>Practical Tutorial</h3>
                <p>If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React . You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React  apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding.</p>
    
                <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
                <p>If you prefer to <strong>learn concepts step by step</strong>, our guide to main concepts is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won’t miss anything as you go along.</p>

                <header>Staying Informed</header>
                <p>The React  blog is the official source for the updates from the React  team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first.</p>
                <p>You can also follow the <a target="_blank" href="#">@React js</a> account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog.</p>
                <p>Not every React  release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React  repository, as well as on the Releases page.</p>

                <header>Versioned Documentation</header>
                <p>This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React . Since React  16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated.</p>
                <code>
                    function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }
